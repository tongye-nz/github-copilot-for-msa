## Prerequisites 📝

Before you join the workshop, please ensure you have the following set up on your machine:

- ✅ [GitHub account](https://github.com/) 🐙
- ✅ [Visual Studio Code installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 💻
- ✅ [GitHub Copilot Extension installed in Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) 🤖
- ✅ [GitHub Copilot Chat extension installed in Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) 💬
- 🛠️ (Optional) Any other Visual Studio Code extensions you’d like to use based on your preferred application stack (Prettier, ESLint, Python, etc.)
- 📖 (Optional) Complete the [Accelerate app development by using GitHub Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/accelerate-app-development-using-github-copilot/) learning path to familiarize yourself with GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat.

## The Goal 🎯

The goal of this workshop is to empower you to build a fully functional application using Github Copilot and Copilot Chat. You’ll learn how to leverage AI to generate code, brainstorm ideas, and create specifications—all while collaborating with Copilot in real-time. By the end of the session, you'll be on your way to having a working application and a deeper understanding of how AI can transform your development process.

The key to using AI to create production ready applications is to provide grounding and context to the AI. This workshop will show you how to do that using the `simple_app_idea_generator` and `specification` chat modes.

## Workshop Agenda 📅

1. **Introduction to AI in Software Development** (10 mins)
   - GitHub Copilot overview
   - Rethinking engineering processes with AI

2. **Agent Mode & Custom Chat Modes** (30 mins)
   - Come up with your app idea with the `simple_app_idea_generator` chat mode
   - Review your idea with `mentor` chat mode and refine it, including deciding on the technology stack

3. **Prompt Files** (30 mins)
   - Create your app specfication with the `/create_spec` custom prompt file
   - Create your implementation plan using a custom prompt file `/create_plan`.
   - Run a last review of your plan and specification with the `mentor` chat mode

4. **Build your application** (15 mins)
   - Ask Copilot in Agent mode to build your application from the Specification and Implementation Plan you created.

5. **Next Steps** (5 mins)
    - AI driven development will be a key part of your future career.
    - It is critical to keep developing your AI skills and knowledge and to lead the way in your future teams.
