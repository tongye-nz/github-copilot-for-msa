# Introduction

This plan implements the missing requirements from the Data Semantic Model Repository Pattern Specification. The current implementation only supports basic local disk persistence through direct `SemanticModel.SaveModelAsync()` and `LoadModelAsync()` methods. This plan adds the repository pattern abstraction with three persistence strategies (Local Disk JSON, Azure Blob Storage, Cosmos DB), lazy loading, dirty tracking, security enhancements, and performance optimizations.

### Phase 2: Local Disk Strategy Enhancement (Priority 4-5)

1. **Enhance existing local disk persistence**
   1. Define class `LocalDiskPersistenceStrategy : ILocalDiskPersistenceStrategy`:
      - Wrap calls to `SemanticModel.SaveModelAsync(DirectoryInfo)` and `SemanticModel.LoadModelAsync(DirectoryInfo)`.
      - Preserve existing public API signatures so that legacy callers are unaffected.
   2. Index file generation:
      - Produce `index.json` in model root listing entity categories (tables, views, storedprocedures) and relative file paths.
      - Use `System.Text.Json` with `WriteIndented = true` for readability.
   3. Validation and safety:
      - Apply `PathValidator` to sanitize `modelPath.FullName` and prevent directory traversal.
      - Enforce entity name length ≤128 via `EntityNameSanitizer`.
      - Log errors through `ILogger<LocalDiskPersistenceStrategy>` with structured context.
   4. Error handling and rollback:
      - Catch `IOException`, `UnauthorizedAccessException`, wrap with descriptive messages.
      - Write to a temp directory and use atomic rename/move to avoid partial writes.

2. **Add CRUD operations on disk**
   1. Extend `ILocalDiskPersistenceStrategy` interface:
      - `Task<bool> ExistsAsync(DirectoryInfo modelPath)`
      - `Task<IEnumerable<string>> ListModelsAsync(DirectoryInfo rootPath)`
      - `Task DeleteModelAsync(DirectoryInfo modelPath)`
   2. Implement methods in `LocalDiskPersistenceStrategy`:
      - `ExistsAsync`: call `Directory.Exists`, validate path security.
      - `ListModelsAsync`: enumerate subfolders under `rootPath`, return model folder names.
      - `DeleteModelAsync`: acquire exclusive lock via `FileStream(FileShare.None)`, delete directory recursively, rollback on errors.
   3. Concurrency and atomicity:
      - Use `FileStream` locks and temp-to-final directory swaps for atomic operations.
      - Ensure file handles are released before moving or deleting.
   4. Testing requirements:
      - Unit tests against `Path.GetTempPath()`-based test directory, covering success and failure scenarios.
      - Regression tests to verify `SaveModelAsync`/`LoadModelAsync` still work on existing model artifacts.

- **RISK-004**: Performance overhead from repository pattern abstraction layer
- **RISK-005**: Cloud service authentication and connection string management complexity
- **RISK-006**: Potential memory leaks from lazy loading proxies if not properly disposed
- **RISK-007**: Race conditions in concurrent scenarios despite protection mechanisms

### Assumptions
